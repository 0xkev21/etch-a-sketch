# Etch a Sketch
Back to the days when we used to play with our little etch a sketch. This is the browser version of it where you can draw different pixelated drawings.

- You can draw with the original black color -- old school.
- You can also change the color to any possible color you want.
- Eraser - To make things right
- Rainbow Mode - To draw with different colors changing on every pixels
- Opacity Mode - To toggle the opacity by 0.2 every time you fill the pixel again.
- Bonus Tip * You can also combine Rainbow mode and Opacity Mode to draw an interesting sketch.

Enjoy !

## About the Project
This is a project I created to complete **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)** assignment.

The page is fully responsive on both 
Desktop & Mobile * but Drawing on mobile is not yet available. You need to tap every time you want to fill a pixel.

This is my own solution. I wrote every line of codes on my own.
